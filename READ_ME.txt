=====================
How to run the program:

1. Write the names of students and class inside 'StudentWorkshop_SampleExcelSheet'
2. Ensure that Excel sheet is closed before running the Python program.
3. Run 'ExcelHelperTool.py' in your terminal/IDE/tool of choice.
4. Re-open the Excel sheet to see the update.

Note: 
- Numbers of students will be taken into account for each calculation, and there is no need
to remove existing workshop information inside the excel sheet.

=====================
Changing variables in Excel and Python

1. The program is currently linked to the name of the Excel file 
(StudentWorkshop_SampleExcelSheet.xlsx) and the sheet name (Gesamt√ºbersicht). If they must 
be changed, make sure to update 'filename' and 'sheetname' inside the python script.

2. Changes to which column and row the student names/class start must be updated in the 
python script. The default is column A,B, C and row 4. 

3. You could change the name of the workshops inside the text file 'workshop_names'. However,
beware that the workshop names on the right side of the Excel sheet does not reflect this 
change. 

4. The order of workshop names in 'workshop_names.txt' is very important, as for now, the 
order of class in the overview in Excel only work for the default order inside the text file.
